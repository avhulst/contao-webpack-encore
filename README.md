# terminal42/contao-webpack-encore

`terminal42/contao-webpack-encore` is an extension for the [Contao CMS](https://contao.org).

It allows you to integrate Encore entrypoints into Contao, either through the page layout,
through .html5-Template methods or through insert tags.

If you use Twig templates, you can use the regular Symfony Encore Bundle features.
